Want to add/fix a snippet? Complain about the style? See the [github
repo][].

The snippets below are ready to use, except for they are written in a
somewhat na√Øve manner: error checking prevents only crashes,
malloc'ing is always optimistic, there are almost no *const* pointers
(for they irritate me) & numbers are oft *int*, even when typing
*size_t* was only 3 characters away.
