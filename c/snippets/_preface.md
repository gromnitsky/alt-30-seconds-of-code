Want to add/fix a snippet? Complain about the style? See the [github
repo](https://github.com/gromnitsky/alt-30-seconds-of-code).

The snippets below are ready to use, except for they are written in a
na√Øve manner: error checking prevents only crashes, malloc'ing is
always optimistic & numbers are oft *int*s.

The following header files are assumed as already included:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <ctype.h>
```
